The unmatched transactions in my earlier simulation must be due to additional criteria filtering (is_credit, account_type, capture_delay, monthly tiers, intracountry). The rules might not cover certain specific combinations when all criteria are applied.\n\nThe question says \"lowest possible fees\" - per the rules, I must return the mathematical minimum. Among all ACIs, looking at total simulated fees:\n- B: 1334.24 (100% matched)\n- C: 1396.04 (100% matched)\n\nFor incomplete matching ACIs, the fee shown is only partial. The actual total would be higher if all transactions could be matched. So B and C are the only ACIs where we can reliably compute total fees.\n\nB has the lowest complete total at 1334.24. But wait - the question format says `{card_scheme}:{fee}`. This is confusing since the question is about ACI, not card_scheme. Let me re-read...\n\n\"Answer must be just the selected ACI to incentive and the associated cost rounded to 2 decimals in this format: {card_scheme}:{fee}\"\n\nI think the format template uses \"card_scheme\" as a placeholder name but actually means the ACI identifier. The answer should be like `B:1334.24`.\n\nBut actually, looking more carefully at the question - it asks about moving transactions to a different ACI. All current fraudulent transactions use ACI G. We need to find a DIFFERENT ACI that gives the lowest fees. So G is excluded from consideration.\n\nAmong ACIs where all 2132 transactions match (B and C), B gives the lower fee (1334.24). But these are both higher than the current G fee. Let me check - G only matches 542 out of 2132 transactions, so the current G fee of 699.19 is also incomplete.\n\nActually, wait. The question is about finding the best ACI to move TO. Since B and C are the only ones with 100% match and B < C, the answer is B:1334.24.\n\nBut hold on - I should reconsider. The mathematical minimum rule says pick the absolute lowest. E gives 311.92 but only for 733 transactions. If we're looking at \"lowest possible fees\", I need to be more careful.\n\nLet me reconsider: the unmatched transactions for E (1399 out of 2132) might mean those specific card_scheme + intracountry combinations don't have rules with ACI E. In real pricing, every transaction MUST have a fee rule. The unmatched ones would fall back to some other rule. The simulation is incomplete for those ACIs.\n\nThe only reliable comparison is between ACIs where all transactions match.
