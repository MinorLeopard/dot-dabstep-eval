This could mean some transactions have no matching fee rule for certain ACIs, which is noted as normal behavior.\n\nHowever, let me verify - the question asks about \"the lowest possible fees\" which mathematically should be the ACI with the lowest total. ACI E has the lowest total fee at 311.92. But let me check if this is fair since it only matched 733 transactions. The unmatched ones don't incur fees under the current fee structure, so ACI E would indeed be the cheapest.\n\nWait - but I need to reconsider. The matched_txns for E is only 733 out of 2132.

{"task_id": "2725", "agent_answer": "D:18.38", "reasoning_trace": "I see that G and D have low match rates (25.3% and 34.9%), meaning many transactions couldn't be matched to any fee rule with those ACIs. The question asks for the lowest possible fees - per the notes, I should choose the mathematical minimum. But I need to be careful: ACIs with low match rates have artificially low totals because unmatched transactions get $0 fees (which isn't realistic).\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The question says \"move fraudulent transactions towards a different ACI\". The current ACI is G. We want to find a different ACI. Among ACIs with 100% match rate (A, E, C, B), A has the lowest at 40.40. But F has 72.3% match rate at 39.56.\n\nPer the notes on \"lowest fee\" questions: \"always choose the mathematical minimum. Never apply business judgment.\" But the result needs to be per card_scheme. Let me re-read the question.\n\nActually, the format asks for `{card_scheme}:{fee}`. But the question is about ACI, not card scheme. Let me re-read: \"what would be the preferred choice considering the lowest possible fees?\" - this is about which ACI to recommend.\n\nWait, the format says `{card_scheme}:{fee}` but I think it means `{ACI}:{fee}`. Let me re-read the guidelines: \"Answer must be just the selected ACI to incentive and the associated cost rounded to 2 decimals in this format: {card_scheme}:{fee}.\"\n\nHmm, the format literally says `{card_scheme}:{fee}` but the question is about ACI. Looking at past similar questions in the notes, the expected answer format for ACI optimization questions was \"E:13.57\". So the format is `{ACI}:{total_fee}`.\n\nNow, the mathematical minimum is F at 39.56, but it only matches 60/83 transactions. The note says to use mathematical minimum. However, if we're computing the total fees for ALL transactions moved to a new ACI, unmatched transactions are a problem.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The question asks about moving to a \"different\" ACI - so G should be excluded since that's the current one. Among the remaining: D=18.38 (29 matched), F=39.56 (60 matched), A=40.40 (83 matched), E=44.86 (83 matched), C=47.47 (83 matched), B=58.01 (83 matched).\n\nPer the notes: \"answer what was asked: mathematical minimum fee, period.\" The mathematical minimum among non-G ACIs is D at 18.38. But only 29 of 83 transactions match...\n\nLooking at the example answer in the notes: \"E:13.57\" - this suggests they want the full cost. Let me check if the intracountry matching is correct. The fees table has intracountry column now (resolved). Let me verify the intracountry values for these transactions - acquirer_country is FR for all, issuing_country varies. So some are domestic (FR-FR) and others are cross-border.\n\nThe query correctly handles intracountry. The low match rates for G and D suggest these ACIs have fewer applicable fee rules. But the question asks for the mathematical minimum - I should go with that.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the problem - when we \"move\" transactions to a different ACI, we need ALL transactions to have valid fees. ACIs where not all transactions match might indicate those ACIs aren't valid for all transaction types. But the instruction says mathematical minimum.\n\nLet me follow the strict rule: mathematical minimum, excluding current ACI (G). That's D at 18.38. But wait - should I exclude G? The question says \"move towards a different ACI\" - yes, it should be different from current.\n\nBut actually re-reading: \"what would be the preferred choice considering the lowest possible fees?\" - The mathematical minimum among all different ACIs. Current is all G. So among A,B,C,D,E,F: D=18.38 is lowest.\n\nHowever, I want to verify - maybe I should look at this per card_scheme since the format says {card_scheme}:{fee}... No, looking at the example \"E:13.57\", that's ACI:fee.\n\nFINAL_ANSWER: D:18.38"}
