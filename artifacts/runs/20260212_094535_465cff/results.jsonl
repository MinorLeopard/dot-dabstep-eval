Use whichever field the question specifies.\nGeneral fraud questions: COUNT transactions where has_fraudulent_dispute='True'.\n\nMONTHLY TIER FILTER (CRITICAL \u2014 MANDATORY for date/month-specific fee questions):\nUse uploads.main.monthly_merchant_stats to get volume_tier and fraud_tier:\n  SELECT volume_tier, fraud_tier FROM monthly_merchant_stats WHERE merchant='X' AND year=Y AND month=M;\nThen filter fees: (f.monthly_volume IS NULL OR f.monthly_volume = volume_tier) AND (f.monthly_fraud_level IS NULL OR f.monthly_fraud_level = fraud_tier).\nSKIPPING THIS FILTER WILL RETURN A SUPERSET \u2014 WRONG ANSWER.\n\nINTRACOUNTRY: 1 if payments.issuing_country = payments.acquirer_country, else 0.\n\nDATE HANDLING: day_of_year 1-indexed.

End with FINAL_ANSWER: <answer>", "dot_response_raw": "The issue is clear - some card_scheme \u00d7 ACI combinations don't have any matching fee rules, causing some transactions to be dropped (not matched). For ACIs A, B, C, all 94 transactions match. For D, E, F only 44 match. For G, only 30 match.\n\nSince we need to move ALL fraudulent transactions to a single ACI, we need an ACI where all 94 transactions have matching fee rules. The valid candidates are A, B, and C. Among those:\n- A: $89.05\n- B: $93.57  \n- C: $88.26\n\nC gives the lowest fee at $88.26. But wait - we need to exclude the current ACI (G) since the question asks about moving to a \"different\" ACI. G is the current one, so all of A, B, C, D, E, F are candidates. But only A, B, C cover all transactions.\n\nActually, let me re-read the question: \"what would be the preferred choice considering the lowest possible fees?\" Per the guidelines: \"always choose the mathematical minimum.\" But if not all transactions match, that's a problem. However, the guidelines also say mathematical minimum without business judgment. \n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The answer format is `{card_scheme}:{fee}`. This suggests the answer should be a single ACI and total fee. Since C covers all 94 transactions with the lowest total fee of $88.26, that's the answer.\n\nBut wait - the format asks for `{card_scheme}:{fee}`. That seems like it should be an ACI, not a card_scheme. Let me re-read... \"Answer must be just the selected ACI to incentive and the associated cost rounded to 2 decimals in this format: {card_scheme}:{fee}.\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing - the format says `{card_scheme}` but the context is about ACI.

Use whichever field the question specifies.\nGeneral fraud questions: COUNT transactions where has_fraudulent_dispute='True'.\n\nMONTHLY TIER FILTER (CRITICAL \u2014 MANDATORY for date/month-specific fee questions):\nUse uploads.main.monthly_merchant_stats to get volume_tier and fraud_tier:\n  SELECT volume_tier, fraud_tier FROM monthly_merchant_stats WHERE merchant='X' AND year=Y AND month=M;\nThen filter fees: (f.monthly_volume IS NULL OR f.monthly_volume = volume_tier) AND (f.monthly_fraud_level IS NULL OR f.monthly_fraud_level = fraud_tier).\nSKIPPING THIS FILTER WILL RETURN A SUPERSET \u2014 WRONG ANSWER.\n\nINTRACOUNTRY: 1 if payments.issuing_country = payments.acquirer_country, else 0.\n\nDATE HANDLING: day_of_year 1-indexed. Jan=1-31, Feb=32-59, Mar=60-90, Apr=91-120, May=121-151, Jun=152-181, Jul=182-212, Aug=213-243, Sep=244-273, Oct=274-304, Nov=305-334, Dec=335-365.\n\n'NOT APPLICABLE' RULE: If a question asks about a concept not in the data model (e.g., 'high-fraud rate fine' \u2014 there are no fines, only fee rules), answer 'Not Applicable'.\n\nReply with ONLY your final answer in EXACTLY this format:\n\nFINAL_ANSWER: <your answer>\n\nIMPORTANT RULES:\n- Your FINAL_ANSWER must contain ONLY the answer value \u2014 no explanations, no units unless asked.\n- Follow the Guidelines section EXACTLY for formatting (commas, decimals, rounding, list format, etc.).\n- If the Guidelines say 'respond with Not Applicable', use exactly: FINAL_ANSWER: Not Applicable\n- If you cannot compute the answer, respond: FINAL_ANSWER: Not Applicable\n- Do NOT say 'I don't know'. Do NOT ask clarifying questions.\n- You MUST always end your response with the FINAL_ANSWER line.\n\nGuidelines:\nAnswer must be just a number rounded to 14 decimals. If a question does not have a relevant or applicable answer for the task, please respond with 'Not Applicable'\n\nQuestion: In January 2023 what delta would Belles_cookbook_store pay if the relative fee of the fee with ID=384 changed to 1?\n\nREMINDER: Use SQL to compute the answer. For fee-related questions involving a specific date/month/merchant, you MUST: (1) Look up monthly_merchant_stats for volume_tier and fraud_tier, (2) Filter fees by monthly_volume and monthly_fraud_level using those tiers. Use merchant_data.capture_delay_bucket to match fees.capture_delay. For fraud questions, use the EXACT country field specified (ip_country vs issuing_country vs acquirer_country).
