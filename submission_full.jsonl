Let me re-read the format: `{card_scheme}:{fee}`.\n\nWait, looking at the format again - it says the answer should be in format `{card_scheme}:{fee}`. But the question asks for the preferred ACI choice. Let me reconsider...\n\nThe question is about the preferred ACI choice considering lowest fees. The answer format seems to ask for a single ACI and associated cost. Let me check if the answer is simply the ACI with the lowest total fee, and report it. But the format says `{card_scheme}:{fee}` which doesn't make sense for an ACI answer.\n\nLet me re-read: \"what would be the preferred choice considering the lowest possible fees?\" - the answer is the ACI. Format: `{card_scheme}:{fee}` - wait, maybe this means something else. Perhaps it's asking which card_scheme + ACI combination, but the format literally says `{card_scheme}:{fee}`.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the guidelines: \"Answer must be just the selected ACI to incentive and the associated cost rounded to 2 decimals in this format: {card_scheme}:{fee}.\"\n\nHmm, this seems contradictory - it says \"selected ACI\" but format is \"card_scheme:fee\". Maybe the format means the ACI value instead of card_scheme? Or maybe the total fee broken down by card_scheme? Let me re-read again...\n\nActually, I think the format literally means: the ACI is the main answer and the fee is the cost. But the format template uses `{card_scheme}` which might be a template error and should be the ACI. Given the instruction \"Answer must be just the selected ACI to incentive and the associated cost\", I think the answer should be: `F:258.80` or `E:133.58` where the first part is the ACI code.\n\nWait, but maybe they want per-card-scheme breakdown. Let me compute by card scheme too just to be safe.\n\nActually, re-reading more carefully: \"the selected ACI to incentive and the associated cost rounded to 2 decimals in this format: {card_scheme}:{fee}\". I think the format is just poorly worded and should be `{aci}:{fee}`. The lowest fee ACI is E with 133.58.\n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. The question asks about the preferred choice. The lowest total fee across all card schemes for the fraudulent transactions when moved to ACI E is 133.58. But let me verify this is correct and the current fee is 279.12.\n\nThe answer format `{card_scheme}:{fee}` likely means the ACI should be listed where `{card_scheme}` is, since the instruction says \"selected ACI to incentive.\"\n\nFINAL_ANSWER: E:133.58"}

But let me also check if maybe the question is simply about which scheme currently has the lowest total fee on its own transactions. Let me verify both interpretations, but I believe steering means \"if all transactions went through scheme X\".\n\nThe answer is NexPay with 233.35 EUR total fee.\n\nWait, but the format asks for `{card_scheme}:{fee}`.
